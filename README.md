# RainMaker
This is a school project using JavaFX.

In this topdown 2D game, you fly around as a helicopter filling ponds with water.

If you are curious in the project, feel free to look at it. 
If you are in following semesters taking the course, I suggest not cloning the repo. 

# Required:
  Java 18
  Azul 18 Java JDK
